A crazy combination of 2048 and Tetris. 2048 blocks fall from on the screen and the player can drag these blocks left and right as they fall (and while they're on the ground). There is a chance that any numbered block up to 512 will fall with 2 being the most probable. They must put two like blocks together to combine them into the subsequent number in the power of 2s.  Of course, 2048 is the highest achievable number. However, as the player's score progresses, the game gets harder. The numbered blocks fall more frequently and blank blocks start to fall. These blank blocks can combine with each other but do not create any higher number and do not award any points. Also, one of them will always remain. These blank blocks will also fall more frequently as the player's score gets higher. The objective of the game is to gain as many points as possible while stacking these blocks within 3 minutes. Once the countdown finishes, the game presents a game over screen from which you can restart. Also note that the player can restart at any time if they feel their game has not gone well.
